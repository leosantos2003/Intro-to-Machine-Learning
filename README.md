# Intro to Machine Learning
  
## About

This repository documents the learnings from completing the [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) course on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

Hands-on project focused on establishing a solid foundation in the workflow of a Machine Learning project, from data exploration to model validation.

* `lesson_2`: basic data exploration; loading and understanding data.

* `lesson_3`: first machine learning model; building the first model.
 
* `lesson_4`: model validation; measuring the performance of the model for testing and comparing alternatives. [(see graphics)](https://github.com/leosantos2003/Intro-to-Machine-Learning/tree/main/lesson_4)
 
* `lesson_5`: underfitting and overfitting; fine-tuning the model for better performance. [(see graphics)](https://github.com/leosantos2003/Intro-to-Machine-Learning/tree/main/lesson_5)
 
* `lesson_6`: random forests; using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm. [(see graphic)](https://github.com/leosantos2003/Intro-to-Machine-Learning/tree/main/lesson_6)
