# Intro to Machine Learning
  
## About

This repository documents the learnings from completing the ["Intro to Machine Learning"](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) course on Kaggle.

Hands-on project focused on establishing a solid foundation in the workflow of a Machine Learning project, from data exploration to model validation.

* `lesson_2.py`: basic data exploration; loading and understanding data.

* `lesson_3.py`: first machine learning model; building the first model.
 
* `lesson_4.py`: model validation; measuring the performance of the model for testing and comparing alternatives.
 
* `lesson_5.py`: underfitting and overfitting; fine-tuning the model for better performance.
 
* `lesson_6.py`: random forests; using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.
